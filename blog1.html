				A blog is a discussion or informational website published on the World
				Wide Web consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style text entries
				(posts). Posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological order,
				so that the most recent post appears first, at the top of the web page.
				Until 2009, blogs were usually the work of a single individual,[citation
				needed] occasionally of a small group, and often covered a single
				subject or topic. In the 2010s, "multi-author blogs" (MABs) emerged,
				featuring the writing of multiple authors and sometimes professionally
				edited. MABs from newspapers, other media outlets, universities, think
				tanks, advocacy groups, and similar institutions account for an
				increasing quantity of blog traffic. The rise of Twitter and other
				"microblogging" systems helps integrate MABs and single-author blogs
				into the news media. Blog can also be used as a verb, meaning to
				maintain or add content to a blog. The emergence and growth of blogs in
				the late 1990s coincided with the advent of web publishing tools that
				facilitated the posting of content by non-technical users who did not
				have much experience with HTML or computer programming. Previously, a
				knowledge of such technologies as HTML and File Transfer Protocol had
				been required to publish content on the Web, and early Web users
				therefore tended to be hackers and computer enthusiasts. In the 2010s,
				the majority are interactive Web 2.0 websites, allowing visitors to
				leave online comments, and it is this interactivity that distinguishes
				them from other static websites.[2] In that sense, blogging can be seen
				as a form of social networking service. Indeed, bloggers not only
				produce content to post on their blogs but also often build social
				relations with their readers and other bloggers.[3] However, there are
				high-readership blogs which do not allow comments. Many blogs provide
				commentary on a particular subject or topic, ranging from philosophy,
				religion, and arts to science, politics, and sports. Others function as
				more personal online diaries or online brand advertising of a particular
				individual or company. A typical blog combines text, digital images, and
				links to other blogs, web pages, and other media related to its topic.
				The ability of readers to leave publicly viewable comments, and interact
				with other commenters, is an important contribution to the popularity of
				many blogs. However, blog owners or authors often moderate and filter
				online comments to remove hate speech or other offensive content. Most
				blogs are primarily textual, although some focus on art (art blogs),
				photographs (photoblogs), videos (video blogs or "vlogs"), music (MP3
				blogs), and audio (podcasts). In education, blogs can be used as
				instructional resources; these are referred to as edublogs.
				Microblogging is another type of blogging, featuring very short posts.
				'Blog' and 'blogging' are now loosely used for content creation and
				sharing on social media, especially when the content is long-form and
				one creates and shares content on regular basis. So, one could be
				maintaining a blog on Facebook or blogging on Instagram. On February 16,
				2011, there were over 156 million public blogs in existence. On February
				20, 2014, there were around 172 million Tumblr[4] and 75.8 million
				WordPress[5] blogs in existence worldwide. According to critics and
				other bloggers, Blogger is the most popular blogging service used today.
				However, Blogger does not offer public statistics.[6][7] Technorati
				lists 1.3 million blogs as of February 22, 2014. Before blogging became
				popular, digital communities took many forms including Usenet,
				commercial online services such as GEnie, Byte Information Exchange
				(BIX) and the early CompuServe, e-mail lists,[14] and Bulletin Board
				Systems (BBS). In the 1990s, Internet forum software created running
				conversations with "threads". Threads are topical connections between
				messages on a virtual "corkboard". From June 14, 1993, Mosaic
				Communications Corporation maintained their "What's New"[15] list of new
				websites, updated daily and archived monthly. The page was accessible by
				a special "What's New" button in the Mosaic web browser. The earliest
				instance of a commercial blog was on the first business to consumer Web
				site created in 1995 by Ty, Inc., which featured a blog in a section
				called "Online Diary". The entries were maintained by featured Beanie
				Babies that were voted for monthly by Web site visitors.[16] The modern
				blog evolved from the online diary where people would keep a running
				account of the events in their personal lives. Most such writers called
				themselves diarists, journalists, or journalers. Justin Hall, who began
				personal blogging in 1994 while a student at Swarthmore College, is
				generally recognized as one of the earlier bloggers,[17] as is Jerry
				Pournelle.[18] Dave Winer's Scripting News is also credited with being
				one of the older and longer running weblogs.[19][20] The Australian
				Netguide magazine maintained the Daily Net News[21] on their web site
				from 1996. Daily Net News ran links and daily reviews of new websites,
				mostly in Australia. Another early blog was Wearable Wireless Webcam, an
				online shared diary of a person's personal life combining text, digital
				video, and digital pictures transmitted live from a wearable computer
				and EyeTap device to a web site in 1994. This practice of semi-automated
				blogging with live video together with text was referred to as
				sousveillance, and such journals were also used as evidence in legal
				matters. Some early bloggers, such as The Misanthropic Bitch, who began
				in 1997, actually referred to their online presence as a zine, before
				the term blog entered common usage.
